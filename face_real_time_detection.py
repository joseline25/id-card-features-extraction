Notice that we have passed the parameter 0 to the VideoCapture() function.
This tells OpenCV to use the default camera on our device. If you have 
multiple cameras attached to your device, you can change this parameter
value accordingly.

create a function to detect faces in the video stream and draw a bounding box around them

"""

The detect_bounding_box function takes the video frame as input.

In this function, we are using the same codes as we did earlier
to convert the frame into grayscale before performing face detection.

Then, we are also detecting the face in this image using the same 
parameter values for scaleFactor, minNeighbors, and minSize as we did previously.

Finally, we draw a green bounding box of thickness 4 around the frame.

frame from our webcam and apply the face detection function to it
